                                        Children may enroll starting at age 3 months. Because babies are born ready to learn, we accept infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and kindergartners through the age of 6. Neuroscience tells us that learning begins at birth, and research confirms that 90 percent of the brain is already developed within the first three years of life. At Beginnings, we make the most of this critical period of “neuroplasticity” to provide our students with a strong foundation that will serve them throughout their lives.

                                        Teachers communicate with parents on a daily basis at drop-off and pick-up. We also schedule regular parent-teacher conferences during which we review and discuss children’s progress. Communication with parents is an important part of our program. Our teachers and our founder are always available to talk with parents.

                                        Parents of students in Title I schools are guaranteed annual notification of their "right to know" about teacher qualifications by their school district. That means parents may request and receive from that office information regarding the professional qualifications of the student's classroom teachers,including:
                                        (a) whether the teacher is state-certified;
                                        (b) whether a teacher is teaching under emergency or other provisional status; and
                                        (c) the baccalaureate degree major of the teacher and any other graduate degree major or certification.

                                        Nest Of Wits students only wear uniforms when this practice is specifically required by one of our host schools for a given academic term, but they are always expected to dress in a manner that is respectful to their fellow students, their teachers, and the culture of our host cities.

                                        We provide nutritious food to our students so they can perform their best in the classroom. Dining with teachers and classmates creates the convivial social atmosphere of a home away from home. We also believe cuisine is an integral part of learning and understanding a culture. Students are exposed to a variety of food experiences during their time in each city, and periodically take cooking lessons that give them a chance to experiment hands-on with local ingredients and flavors. Special dietary needs should be discussed with school staff prior to enrolling at Nets Of Wits School.

                                        We welcome parent visits to the school with arrangements made at least two weeks in advance. The best time for parents to visit is at the end of a term to ensure that students do not have other academic obligations that would prevent parents from spending quality time with their son/daughter.

                                        No, Nets Of Wits School does not have any application deadlines for student admissions. We have a rolling admissions policy, and we will accept applications around the year as long as places are available. Admissions will also be made around the year, subject to vacancies and availability of space in the concerned classes.However, we are a small school with a class limit of 24 students per year group through Grade 5 and 30 students per year group in the Secondary School. We have only one section per year group, and when a year group is full, there are no further admissions. Therefore, it is advisable to take admissions earl.

                                        Saturdays are very busy at Nest Of Wits School. We attend educational workshops with local experts, take advantage of fun museums and educational events in our host city, and sometimes even head out of the city for scientific and cultural trips. We also run supervised activities on Sundays, but usually that’s the perfect day for students to relax, gather their thoughts, and recharge their batteries for the week ahead.

                                        Teachers generally have a great deal of autonomy, more so than most jobs that college graduates find right out of college. You are entrusted with huge responsibility on Day One and you have the opportunity to design your classroom culture and design your lesson and unit plans. Every school varies in terms of the degree of autonomy teachers have, so when you are interviewing for jobs, this is a good question to ask the principal and teachers at the schools you are considering.
